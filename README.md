## Dataset
College Basketball stats from 2013 - 2025 (not incluing the 2020 season as there was no post season). 

Data outlines different statistical metrics over the basketball season and results in postseason.

### Modifications
In the data folder is a modified version of the dataset

- Added the results of the 2025 postseason

- RANK, 3PR, and 3PD were removed as they don't appear in the main cbb.csv with years 2024 and prior.

- Removed SEED in code (NCAA seed in tournament) as this would tell us whether the team made the tournament.

- Removed TEAM in code to better generalize which stats are more predictive of a tournament bid

## Training/Validation
Training and validation utilize a 7-window sliding setup (3 years train, 1 validate) to see how the model generalizes over time. The window implementation is found in the *proj_setup* module.

```python
def init_windows(initial_train, i)
```
